# Parallelism at Any Scale

Chapel is built from the ground up with productive and performance parallel computing in mind. Conventionally, leveraging parallelism at different scales requires different programming models with different interfaces. Chapel programs can leverage the three types of parallelism with a single unified set of language features:

# Parallel Programming Features that Fit Together

Conventional distributed programming requires programmers to write their code in terms of individual processes, manually coordinating all communication between each node. Distributed programming doesn't have to be this way, and Chapel's _global-view programming_ is the perfect alternative. You can declare and compute on distributed data structures with the same code you would use for a completely local version. __Keep the performance of distributed parallelism, lose the finicky gets and puts. Or don't!__ If you need, you can distribute data and coordinate message passing manually, or mix manual control with global-view programming. The beauty of Chapel is that you can choose the level(s) of abstraction best fit for your project.
